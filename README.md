## Algorithm
- Clearly defined problem statement, input, and output
- The steps in the algorithm need to be in a very specific order
- The steps also need to be distinct
- The algorithm should produce a result
- The algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time

## Big O notation
- Theoretical definition of the complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size

## O(n)
- Order of magnitude of complexity

## Time complexity
| Runtime | Big O Notation |
|---------|----------------|
|Constant|O(1)|
|Logarithmic|O(log n)|
|Linear|O(n)|
|Quadratic|O(n**2)|
|Quasilinear|O(n log n)|
|Exponential|O(x**n)|


## Search Algorithms
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Recursive Binary Search

## Recursion and Space Complexity
- Recursive Functions
- Space Complexity

## Algorithmic Thinking
- Breaking a problem down into a clearly defined input and output
- Distinct set of steps that solves a problem

## Data Structures
- Array
- Linked List

## Data Structures Operations
- Access and read values
- Search for an arbitrary values
- Insert values at any point into the structure
- Delete values in the structure

## Sorting Algorithms
- Bogo Sort
