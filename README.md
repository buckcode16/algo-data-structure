# Algorithm and Data Structure

##Algorithm
- Clearly defined problem statement, input, and output
- The steps in the algorithm need to be in a very specific order
- The steps also need to be distinct
- The algorithm should produce a result
- The algorithm sohuld complete in a finite amount of time

##Big O notation
- Theoretical definition of the complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size

##O(n)
- Order of magnitude of complexity

##Time complexity
- Constant O(1) & Logarithmic Time O(log n)
- Linear O(n) & Quadratic Time O(n**2)
- Quasilinear Time O(n log n)
- Exponential Time O(x**n)
